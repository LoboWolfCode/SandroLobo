        <p>Why did Kim Jong Un give saltine crackers to Trump during their meeting?</p>
        <p>The saltine cracker incident reportedly happened during one of the meetings between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump as a somewhat peculiar and light-hearted gesture. According to some sources, it was meant as a symbolic act to break the ice and show a more personal, human side during the otherwise tense and formal diplomatic discussions. However, it's important to note that these meetings often involve many layers of symbolism and interpretation, so different people might see the gesture in different ways.</p>

        <p>Why did Dwight crash his car into the office building?</p>
        <p>In "The Office" (U.S. version), Dwight Schrute crashes his car into the office building in Season 4, Episode 6 ("Branch Wars"). He does this because Michael Scott, the branch manager, insists on racing their cars to a client meeting as a show of competitiveness. Dwight, who takes everything to the extreme, drives recklessly and accidentally crashes his car into the building. The scene is a humorous moment that highlights Dwight's overzealous nature and dedication to his job.</p>
